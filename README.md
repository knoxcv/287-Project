287-Project
===========

We will use verilog to make a 2-player game of connect 3, display the game on a monitor, and the DE-2 board will serve as a controller that will alternate to the next player once a play is made. 

We will need to look up how to make the game rule by some algorithm and how to display it on the monitor by using VGA, and connect that to the DE-2 board so that it can serve as a controller. We plan on splitting the work evenly.
