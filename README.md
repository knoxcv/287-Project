Connect 3 Proposal:

We will make a 2-player game of connect 3 where we will display the game on a monitor, and the DE2-115 board will serve as a controller that will alternate to the next player once a play is made. 

Tasks:

We will need to look up how to make and display the game on the monitor, and connect that to the DE2-115 board so that it can serve as a controller. If we have time we will make it so that the winner will display on the screen once the game is over. To do all of this we plan on splitting the work evenly, and a lot will be done in lab together.
