287-Project
===========

We will make a 2-player game of connect 3 where we will display the game on a monitor, and the DE-2 board will serve as a controller that will alternate to the next player once a play is made. 

We will need to look up how to make and display the game on the monitor, and connect that to the DE-2 board so that it can serve as a controller. We plan on splitting the work evenly.
