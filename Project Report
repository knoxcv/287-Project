Description:

For our final project we decided to make a game of connect 4. We used 7 switches, each represented a different 
column on the game board, and we had a button for player 1 to push on their turn, and also on for player 2.
The game starts on player 1's turn, and alternates to the next player once a move is made. To make a move you
have to flip the switch for the column you want, and press the button corresponding to the player. Once the game
is won you will no longer be able to make a move, and to see who won you flip the switch next to the reset button,
and it will display a 1 if player 1 wins, and a 2 is player 2 wins. To win the game you have to have 4 of the same
color making a row, a column, or a diagnal anywhere on the game board. 


Conclusions:

Overall, working on this project helped to give us a better understanding of verilog. Even using Bailey's code for
the vga we had problems with it when trying to display multiple colors on the monitor. Then we talked with Wilson,
and he helped us figure out how to get all of our colors to display. Once we got the vga to work, we spent most of 
our time working on the state machine for the game. For a while we struggled with the count for the board, it would
drop 2 blocks on each turn, but we put in a else statement and got it to drop 1 block each time. Once we figured 
out that problem, we worked on how to find the winner for the game, and to do this we used for loops. Though there
is a glitch in it, and sometimes while playing the game, when you make a move all of the spaces go white. We 
searched and searched to find out why it does that but we never figured it out.  Overall making connect four was a 
challenge, but we got it to work.
