Description:

For our final project we decided to make a game of connect 4. We used 7 switches, each represented a different 
column on the game board, and we had a button for player 1 to push on their turn, and also on for player 2.
The game starts on player 1's turn, and alternates to the next player once a move is made. To make a move you
have to flip the switch for the column you want, and press the button corresponding to the player. Once the game
is won you will no longer be able to make a move, and to see who won you flip the switch next to the reset button,
and it will display a 1 if player 1 wins, and a 2 is player 2 wins. To win the game you have to have 4 of the same
color making a row, a column, or a diagnal anywhere on the game board.
